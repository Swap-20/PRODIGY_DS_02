# Titanic Survival Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, identifying trends and relationships between passenger features and survival rates.

## 🧾 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- **Files Used**: `train.csv`

## 🔍 Key Questions

- What features are most correlated with survival?
- Did women and children have higher survival rates?
- How did class, fare, and embarkation point affect survival?
- What missing data exists, and how should it be handled?


## 🧪 EDA Process

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values (Age, Cabin)
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features (e.g., Title from Name)
- **Visualization**: Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize trends
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis and group-based survival rates

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Gender**: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Class**: Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rates.
- **Age**: Children were more likely to survive.
- **Fare**: Higher fare correlated with higher survival chances.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
